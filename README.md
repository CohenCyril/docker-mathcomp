# docker-mathcomp

This repository provides [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images of the [Mathematical Components](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp) library for the [Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq) proof assistant.

These images are based on the [coqorg/coq](https://hub.docker.com/r/coqorg/coq/) images, itself based on [Debian 9](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) and relying on [opam 2.0](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Manual.html).

See also the [docker-coq wiki](https://github.com/coq-community/docker-coq/wiki) for details about how to use such images locally or in a CI context.
